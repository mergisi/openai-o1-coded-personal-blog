## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the blog page.
2. `styles.css`: Contains all the CSS for styling the blog.
3. `scripts.js`: JavaScript file for dynamically rendering blog posts.

## Prompts Used to Generate This Project

This project was created in response to the following prompts:

1. Initial prompt: "create a personalized blog page with all coding"
   
   This prompt initiated the creation of the basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the blog.

2. Follow-up prompt: "how can I run this code on local"
   
   This prompt led to the creation of instructions on how to run the blog locally, which are included in the "Running the Project Locally" section of this README.


These prompts guided the development process and shaped the final structure and content of this project.

## About This Project
